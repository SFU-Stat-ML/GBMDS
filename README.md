# GBMDS

An R package described in the manuscript "Generalized Bayesian Multidimensional Scaling and Model Comparison"

## Summary
GBMDS is an R package of a recently proposed method for dimension reduction that represents objects as points in a low-dimensional space using a given collection of pairwise dissimilarities between objects. GBMDS is a more comprehensive Bayesian modeling framework which incorporates general dissimilarity metrics and non-Gaussian errors. An adaptive inference framework is designed using the annealed SMC algorithm to obtain Bayesian solutions under the proposed GBMDS model.
